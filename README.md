# CarRetailerSystem
The Car Retailer System, operating via a text interface, offers functionalities such as automated test data generation, nearest car retailer lookup, car purchase advice, and placing car orders. 
The system ensures randomized test data, presents a user menu, and handles tasks like identifying the nearest retailer by postcode, advising on car purchases, and validating and processing car orders based on business hours and user input.

## System Architecture

Upon initiating the program, the Main Menu will be displayed. `Find the nearest car retailer` prompts users to check the nearest car retailer by entering a valid postcode. 
`Get car purchase advice` allows users to receive car purchase advice by entering a car retailer ID. The subsequent Sub-Menu offers additional functionalities for obtaining specific car advice based on user preferences, such as car types or licence types. 
`Place a car order` provides a comprehensive overview of all retailer and car stock information, allowing users to place a car order by entering a retailer ID and car ID.
